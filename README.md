# GitHub Download tracker


GitHubReleaseTracker is a tool for tracking the release information of a specific GitHub repository.

## Installation and Usage

To use this project, you need to set the `owner` and `repo` variables to your own GitHub username and repository name:



owner = "your-github-username"

repo = "your-repository-name"

Make sure to configure these parameters correctly, otherwise the tool wonâ€™t work as expected.
